# Carholo - Wikipedia Article Draft

== Carholo ==

'''Carholo''' is an interactive web-based 3D visualization and configurator application focused on the [[Porsche 911]] automobile. The project provides an immersive experience for exploring and interacting with a detailed 3D model of the Porsche 911, featuring part inspection, historical information, and interactive elements.

== Overview ==

Carholo is built using modern web technologies including [[Three.js]] for 3D rendering and [[JavaScript]] for interactivity. The application presents a cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic with a distinctive yellow/gold color scheme and retro-futuristic design elements.

== Features ==

=== Interactive 3D Visualization ===
The core of Carholo is an interactive 3D model of the Porsche 911 that users can rotate and explore. The model is rendered using Three.js and supports mouse and gamepad controls.

=== Part Inspection ===
Users can interact with individual components of the vehicle to view detailed information about each part, including maintenance status and specifications.

=== Porsche History Overlay ===
